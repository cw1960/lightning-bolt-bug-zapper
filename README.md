# Lightning Bolt Bug Zapper Extension

## Authentication Fix

The extension had a critical issue with the Supabase authentication that has been fixed. The issue was:

1. **Incorrect Supabase Client Initialization**: 
   - The code was using `supabase.createClient()` instead of `window.supabase.createClient()`
   - This caused the client to be undefined, resulting in all database operations failing

2. **Missing Global Function Reference**:
   - The `saveToSupabase` function was defined in fixed-supabase.js but not attached to the window object
   - In popup.js, the code was trying to call `saveToSupabase` as a global function, but it wasn't accessible

### The Fix

The following changes were made to fix these issues:

1. **Proper Supabase Client Initialization**:
   ```javascript
   // INCORRECT (original code)
   this.client = supabase.createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
   
   // CORRECT (fixed code)
   this.client = window.supabase.createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
   ```

2. **Exposed the saveToSupabase Function Globally**:
   ```javascript
   // INCORRECT (original code)
   async function saveToSupabase(user, password, claudeKey, geminiKey) {
     // Function implementation
   }
   
   // CORRECT (fixed code)
   window.saveToSupabase = async function(user, password, claudeKey, geminiKey) {
     // Function implementation
   }
   ```

## How to Use

1. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select this folder
2. Open the extension popup and create a new account with:
   - Your name
   - Email address
   - Password
   - At least one API key (Claude or Gemini)
3. The user data will now be properly saved to the Supabase database
