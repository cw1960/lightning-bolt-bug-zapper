# Lightning Bolt Bug Zapper Extension - Fixed Version

This is a fixed version of the Lightning Bolt Bug Zapper extension with the Supabase authentication issues resolved.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Incorrect Supabase Client Initialization**:
   - Changed `supabase.createClient()` to `window.supabase.createClient()`
   - This ensures the global Supabase object is properly accessed

2. **Missing Global Function Reference**:
   - Made the `saveToSupabase` function accessible globally by attaching it to the window object
   - This allows the popup.js file to call the function correctly

3. **Added Type Definitions**:
   - Added `UserSettings` type to support proper TypeScript integration
   - Created proper TypeScript files for React integration

4. **Fixed Syntax Errors**:
   - Fixed missing commas, parentheses, and other syntax errors in the Supabase client code
   - Added proper error handling and logging

## How to Test

1. Extract the `lightning-bolt-ext-fixed-final.zip` file
2. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the extracted folder
3. Open the extension popup and create a new account with:
   - Your name
   - Email address
   - Password
   - At least one API key (Claude or Gemini)
4. The user data will now be properly saved to the Supabase database
